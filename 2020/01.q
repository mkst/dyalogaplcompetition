1: Let's Split!

Write a function that, given a right argument Y which is a scalar or a non-empty vector and a left argument X which is a single non-zero integer so that its absolute value is less or equal to â‰¢Y, splits Y into a vector of two vectors according to X, as follows:

If X>0, the first vector contains the first X elements of Y and the second vector contains the remaining elements.
If X<0, the second vector contains the last |X elements of Y and the first vector contains the remaining elements.
